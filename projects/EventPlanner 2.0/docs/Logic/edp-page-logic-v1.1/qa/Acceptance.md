# Acceptance — Undo / Reset (v1.1)

- Check‑In shows toast with Undo; Undo restores counts immediately.
- ⌘Z undoes the last change within 10 minutes.
- Reset dialog options behave exactly as defined (fields cleared; statuses set).
- Manager override required when event is in progress and choosing DNA (setting on).
- History timeline shows each change and allows Revert; Revert produces a new history row.
- Exports reflect the current state after resets.
- Emails (if enabled) only fire when checkbox selected; respect opt‑outs.
