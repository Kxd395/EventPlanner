# EventDeskPro ‚Äî Logic & Flow SSOT (v1.5)
Last Updated: 2025-08-29T23:59:00Z

This supersedes UI_SPEC_ASCII.md, ISSUES_CHECKLIST.md, and SWIFT_APP_LOGIC_PROMPT.md as the single source of truth for EventDeskPro (macOS/iOS). All changes to behavior/labels/flows must update this doc via PR.

0) What changed since v1.1 (highlights)
‚Ä¢ New Event modal: explicit ‚ÄúMax guests (capacity)‚Äù field with helper copy ‚ÄúUse 0 for unlimited. Whole numbers only.‚Äù Time zone is a Picker (IANA IDs), not a free‚Äëtext UTC string.
‚Ä¢ Unified menus: Import and Export are dropdowns on Events, Attendees, Members (and optional Reports). Formats: CSV, JSON, Markdown (.md), TXT. Scope: All / Filtered / Selected. Filenames: context_YYYY-MM-DD_entity.ext. Role gating: CSV/JSON can be grayed out if user lacks PII export rights.
‚Ä¢ Attendee editor = 2 cards: Contact (Global) and Participation (Event‚Äëspecific) with Member, ‚≠ê VIP, Walk‚Äëin flag, Confirmed, status, timestamps, notes, and auto‚ÄëDNA timer (inherit event default or per‚Äëattendee override).
‚Ä¢ Capacity surfacing: Attendees tab shows capacity progress (‚ÄúX / Max guests‚Äù or ‚ÄúUnlimited‚Äù) and uses the same wording app‚Äëwide.
‚Ä¢ Badges on rows: ‚≠ê VIP, üè∑ Member, ‚ö° Walk‚Äëin, ‚òëÔ∏é Confirmed (in addition to status color).
‚Ä¢ Analytics: confirmed formulas, capacity=0 means unlimited (no denominator cap).
‚Ä¢ Appendix: Build/FFI quick triage for exit code 9 (linking/runpath/codesign) kept for devs.

# EventDeskPro ‚Äî Logic & Flow SSOT (v1.1)
Last Updated: 2025-08-29 23:15:47Z

**Scope**: This document consolidates and supersedes **UI_SPEC_ASCII.md**, **ISSUES_CHECKLIST.md**, and **SWIFT_APP_LOGIC_PROMPT.md** into a single, authoritative reference for the Swift/iOS/macOS implementation of EventDeskProApp. It resolves identified contradictions (e.g., color mappings, analytics formulas), fills gaps (e.g., missing buttons, flows, functions from issues like VIP tagging and audit trails), and incorporates best practices (e.g., MVVM architecture, security considerations, testing). Version history tracks changes; this is v1.1 (updated for clarity, added security/privacy section, refined QA checklist, and included command palette from original improvements). Use this as the SSOT‚Äîany spec changes must update this file via approved PRs.

1) Architecture & Principles (no change)
- **MVVM Pattern**: Use Models (from Rust FFI via EDPCore.swift), ViewModels (business logic, e.g., status updates), and Views (SwiftUI presentation). Decouple UI from core for testability.
- **Data Handling**: Offline-first with local persistence (e.g., SQLite via Rust core); queue actions for sync. Validate inputs client-side (e.g., email regex). Use async/await for FFI calls; handle errors with custom enums.
- **Security & Privacy**: Authenticate users (e.g., login flow with roles: admin/staff); role-based access (e.g., managers for overrides). Encrypt PII (Keychain/SQLite encryption). Audit all changes. Comply with GDPR/CCPA‚Äîadd consent toggles for emails/SMS. No analytics without opt-in.
- **Performance**: Lazy-load lists (SwiftUI List with pagination for 1000+ attendees); cache searches. Profile with Instruments.
- **Testing**: 80% coverage‚Äîunit (XCTest for formulas), UI (XCUITest for flows), snapshots. CI/CD via GitHub Actions.
- **Internationalization**: Use NSLocalizedString; support RTL, Dynamic Type, locale-based dates/timezones.
- **Extensibility**: Custom statuses map to canonical (e.g., new status inherits from Pre-Reg); persist in settings.

2) Time & Timezone (standard)
‚Ä¢ Timezone control: IANA identifier Picker everywhere a TZ is set/edited. Default to system; include UTC and common regions. Persist the IANA ID. Warning if unknown ID (save rules per policy). Display human dates with tz short name; ISO‚Äë8601 for storage/exports.

3) Pages (inventory)
- **Dashboard (Events List)**: Overview of events with Reg% mini-bars.
- **Attendees Tab**: List with filters, search, sorting, status chips.
- **Attendee Detail Drawer**: Right panel for editing/viewing.
- **Add Attendee (Search-first)**: Modal for searching/creating.
- **Walk-in Registration**: Minimal modal for quick adds.
- **Reports & Analytics**: Charts and summaries.
- **Settings**: App-wide customizations.
- **CSV Import/Export**: Preview modals.
- **Global Member Profile**: View/edit global contact (deduped by email/phone).
- **Error/Loading/Empty States**: Overlays/placeholders (cross-cutting).
- **Shortcuts Overlay**: Global help modal.
- **Command Palette**: Quick actions search (‚åò‚áßP, from improvements).

4) Buttons & Actions (canonical)
Each button includes trigger, logic, and outcome (per SWIFT_APP_LOGIC_PROMPT.md template). All actions emit audit logs and refresh relevant views (e.g., via @Published in ViewModels).

### Dashboard
- **[ + New Event ]**: Trigger: Tap. Logic: Open creation form; validate fields (name, date, capacity). Outcome: Add event to list; navigate to it.
- **Event Row Actions (Open/Edit/Delete)**: Trigger: Tap row/swipe. Logic: Open ‚Üí load tabs; Edit ‚Üí modal form; Delete ‚Üí confirm dialog, cascade remove participants. Outcome: Update list; refresh counts.

- **Merge Duplicates**: Trigger: Detect/suggest. Logic: Confirm; combine records. Outcome: Deduped list.
- **[ Close ]**: Trigger: Tap. Logic: Save changes. Outcome: Return to prior view.

### Cross-Cutting
- **Command Palette (‚åò‚áßP)**: Trigger: Shortcut. Logic: Search actions (e.g., "Add Attendee"). Outcome: Trigger selected flow.
- **Shortcuts Overlay ([ ? ])**: Trigger: Shortcut. Logic: Display list. Outcome: Modal help.

## 3. Status State Machine
**Canonical Statuses** (enum in core):
- `preRegistered` (default for adds)
- `walkIn`
- `checkedIn`
- `didNotAttend` (DNA)
- `cancelled` (separate; excludes from metrics)

**Extensions**: Custom statuses via settings (map to canonical, e.g., "Speaker" ‚Üí preRegistered + VIP).

**Transitions & Rules**:
- Pre-Reg ‚Üí Confirmed (bool flag) ‚Üí Checked-In
- Pre-Reg/Walk-in ‚Üí Checked-In (timestamp)
- Any ‚Üí DNA (override if event in progress; auto post-timeout)
- Any ‚Üí Cancelled (confirm; remove from counts)
- Undo: Allowed for Check-In/DNA with required reason (logged).

**Side Effects**:
- Timestamps: checkedInAt, dnaAt.
- Notifications: Email/SMS for confirm/check-in (toggleable).
- Audit Trail: Log all changes (user, time, from/to).

## 4. Analytics & Formulas
All via FFI aggregations; real-time updates via observers.

- **Reg% (Dashboard)**: `(preRegistered + walkIn + checkedIn) / capacity * 100`. Excludes DNA/cancelled. Refresh <1s.
- **No-show Rate (Reports)**: `(DNA / (preRegistered + walkIn)) * 100`. Consistent denominator with Reg%.
- **Conversion Funnel**: Pre-Reg ‚Üí Confirmed (%) ‚Üí Checked-In (%).
- **Check-in Curve**: Buckets (e.g., 15-min) from event start; series of checkedInAt timestamps.
- **Empty Handling**: Graceful placeholders (e.g., "No data yet").

## 5. Navigation Flow
- Dashboard ‚Üí Tap event ‚Üí Tabs (Attendees/Reports/Settings)
- Attendees ‚Üí Tap row ‚Üí Drawer
- Attendees ‚Üí Buttons ‚Üí Modals (Add/Walk-in/Import)
- Drawer ‚Üí [Open Member Profile] ‚Üí Global Profile
- Global: Esc/Back restores prior scroll/tab.
- Deep Link: `/events/:id?tab=attendees&highlight=:attendeeId` ‚Üí Scroll + highlight (500ms).
- Command Palette ‚Üí Any action/flow.
- No dead ends: All modals have Cancel/Close.

## 6. Error/Empty/Loading
- **Empty**: "No attendees yet ‚Äî [Add Attendee]" CTA.
- **Loading**: Spinner (‚è≥).
- **Error**: Banner (‚ö†Ô∏è) + [Retry] / [View Logs] (audit/errors).

## 7. Accessibility & Shortcuts
- Contrast ‚â•4.5:1; labels/icons augment colors.
- Focus order logical; no traps.
- Shortcuts: / (search), ? (overlay), N (new event), A (add), W (walk-in), Esc (close), ‚åò‚áßP (palette).

## 8. Contradictions Resolved
- **Colors**: Fixed to authoritative spec (Blue Pre-Reg, Purple Walk-in, Green Checked-In, Gray DNA). Ignored issue suggestions (Amber/Red) to avoid fork.
- **Metrics**: Standardized formulas (include Walk-ins in no-show denominator; added Cancelled exclusion).
- **Statuses**: Canonical fixed + custom extensible (settings map to core).
- **DNA/Cancelled**: Distinct; Cancelled for preemptive removal.
- **Other**: Reg% excludes future Cancelled; import dedupes transients.

## 9. QA Checklist (Expanded for Dev & QA)
- [ ] Each screen has ‚â•1 actionable element (e.g., button).
- [ ] Every button has mapped trigger ‚Üí logic ‚Üí outcome; no TBD.
- [ ] Status machine enforced; invalid transitions blocked.
- [ ] Analytics match formulas in sample data (e.g., 10 Pre-Reg + 5 Walk-in = 15 numerator).
- [ ] Colors/contrast validated (e.g., via Simulator Accessibility Inspector).
- [ ] Navigation covers all screens; no dead ends (test back/esc).
- [ ] CSV import: Preview shows totals/errors/duplicates; dedupes work.
- [ ] Settings persist across relaunches; hot-reload (e.g., color changes).
- [ ] Reports: Render for empty/non-empty; charts handle zero data.
- [ ] Security: Role checks for overrides; PII encrypted.
- [ ] Tests: Unit for formulas; UI for flows; i18n for locales.
- [ ] Performance: No lag in large lists; offline mode functional.

This updated v1.1 refines structure (e.g., grouped buttons by screen, added architecture notes), fills minor gaps (e.g., command palette, merge in profile), and enhances best practices (e.g., security section). I recommend keeping this as a **new merged SSOT doc** (e.g., name it **EVENTDESKPRO_SSOT.md**) for reference alongside originals during transition‚Äîthen archive the old ones once validated. If you prefer restructuring into a direct replacement for **SWIFT_APP_LOGIC_PROMPT.md** (e.g., with its Plan ‚Üí Execute format), let me know for that version!



Here‚Äôs the **merged, authoritative doc (v1.1)** you asked for ‚Äî I‚Äôve folded in all contradictions, missing flows, and best practices. This now functions as a complete SSOT for EventDeskPro logic/flows:

# EventDeskPro ‚Äî Logic & Flow SSOT (v1.1)

**Scope**: This document consolidates and supersedes **UI\_SPEC\_ASCII.md**, **ISSUES\_CHECKLIST.md**, and **SWIFT\_APP\_LOGIC\_PROMPT.md** into a single, authoritative reference for the Swift/iOS/macOS implementation of EventDeskProApp. It resolves contradictions (colors, formulas), fills gaps (VIP tagging, audit trails, etc.), and incorporates best practices (MVVM, security, testing).

Version history tracks changes; this is **v1.1** (added security/privacy section, refined QA, included command palette). Any changes must update this file via approved PRs.

---

## Architecture Notes (Best Practices)

* **MVVM**: Core models (Rust FFI ‚Üí EDPCore.swift), SwiftUI Views, ViewModels as glue.
* **Data**: Offline-first (SQLite via Rust core). Queue actions for sync.
* **Security & Privacy**: Role-based access (manager overrides), Keychain + SQLite crypto, audit logs, GDPR/CCPA consent for notifications.
* **Performance**: Lazy lists, caching, Instruments profiling.
* **Testing**: Unit (XCTest formulas), UI (XCUITest flows), snapshots. CI/CD with GitHub Actions.
* **Internationalization**: NSLocalizedString, RTL support, locale-aware dates.
* **Extensibility**: Custom statuses map to canonical enums; persisted in settings.

---

## Time Zone Consistency (v1.3)

- Use a single reusable component for all time zone inputs: `TimezonePicker(timezoneId:)`.
- Behavior:
  - Defaults to the system time zone at the top of the list (shown as ‚ÄúSystem (America/‚Ä¶ )‚Äù).
  - Presents a curated list of common IANA identifiers (UTC, US regions, London/Berlin, Tokyo/Singapore, Sydney).
  - Binds to a `String` IANA identifier and persists that value in the DB/API.
  - Accessible label provided; supports keyboard selection.
- Applied in:
  - New Event modal (create flow)
  - Event Settings (edit flow)
  - Settings (global default)
- Validation:
  - If the identifier is not recognized by `TimeZone(identifier:)`, a warning appears beneath the picker; saves may still proceed if business rules permit.
  - Includes a built‚Äëin search field to filter the list (falls back to full IANA list when searching; curated list otherwise).
- Rationale:
  - Ensures consistent UX and reduces invalid entries compared to free‚Äëform text fields.
