# Roadmap (Condensed)
Last Updated: 2025-08-29 23:15:47Z

## Phase 1 — Attendee Editing & Linking (Must Have)
- Attendee side panel (Contact vs Participation)
- Status actions with safeguards + audit reasons
- Member linking + deep-links both ways
- CSV import preview/commit; CSV export
- Analytics baseline instrumentation
- Migration dual-write/backfill/pivot

Exit: End-to-end: add attendee → edit contact → check in → open member → return with highlight.

## Phase 2 — Navigation & A11y Polish
- Breadcrumbs, tab/query persistence, highlight scroll
- Keyboard shortcuts + focus management
- Empty/loading/error states across lists

## Phase 3 — Reports & Settings
- 3 charts (attendance over time, no-show rate, check-in curve)
- Export PDF/CSV; org settings (timezone/theme/notifications)

## Ongoing
- Testing & CI gates; coverage growth
- Internationalization scaffolding
- Performance & accessibility improvements
