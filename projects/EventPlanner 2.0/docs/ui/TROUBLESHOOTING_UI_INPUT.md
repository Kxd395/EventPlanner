# Troubleshooting: Text Input Not Working in UI Fields
Last Updated: 2025-08-29 23:15:47Z

This document addresses the critical issue where users are unable to type into `TextField` or `TextEditor` components in the SwiftUI application.

## 1. Symptom

When a user clicks into a text field, the cursor appears, but typing characters does nothing. Often, a system "bonk" or error sound is heard with each key press. This affects all text fields across the app, including those for creating events, adding attendees, and searching.

## 2. Root Cause: Bare-Key Keyboard Shortcuts

This issue is caused by the incorrect implementation of keyboard shortcuts.

The project's documentation (`PROGRESS.md`, `SWIFT_APP.md`) confirms the implementation of shortcuts using bare keys:
-   `A` for "Add Attendee"
-   `W` for "Walk-in"
-   `/` for "Search"

When a SwiftUI view uses the `.keyboardShortcut()` modifier with only a key (e.g., `.keyboardShortcut("w")`), it registers a global listener for that key. This listener intercepts the key press before it can be processed by any other UI element, including a focused text field.

The system sees the key press, tries to execute the shortcut's action, and consumes the event. The text field never receives the character, so no text is entered.

**Problematic Code Example:**
```swift
// This code will prevent the letter 'w' from being typed in ANY text field in the app.
Button("Add Walk-in") { /* ... */ }
    .keyboardShortcut("w")
```

## 3. Solution: Add Command Key Modifiers

The universal solution is to modify all such shortcuts to require the **Command (⌘)** key. This is standard practice for application-level shortcuts and avoids conflicts with basic text input.

### Action Plan

1.  **Perform a project-wide search** in your Swift code for `.keyboardShortcut(`.

2.  **Inspect every result.** Any shortcut that uses a letter, number, or symbol without a `modifiers` parameter is incorrect and must be fixed.

3.  **Add the `.command` modifier** to each one.

### Code Fix

Locate the buttons or controls associated with the problematic shortcuts and apply the following change:

```swift
// BEFORE (Incorrect)
Button("Add Walk-in") { /* ... */ }
    .keyboardShortcut("w")

Button("Add Attendee") { /* ... */ }
    .keyboardShortcut("a")

Button("Focus Search") { /* ... */ }
    .keyboardShortcut("/")

// AFTER (Correct)
Button("Add Walk-in") { /* ... */ }
    .keyboardShortcut("w", modifiers: .command) // Shortcut is now ⌘+W

Button("Add Attendee") { /* ... */ }
    .keyboardShortcut("a", modifiers: .command) // Shortcut is now ⌘+A

Button("Focus Search") { /* ... */ }
    .keyboardShortcut("/", modifiers: .command) // Shortcut is now ⌘+/
```

### Secondary Checks

If the problem persists after fixing all keyboard shortcuts, consider these less likely causes:

-   **View Hierarchy:** Use Xcode's "Debug View Hierarchy" tool to ensure no invisible overlay is blocking input to your text fields. If you find one, you can apply the `.allowsHitTesting(false)` modifier to it.
-   **Xcode Cache:** Sometimes Xcode's build cache can become corrupted.
    1.  Clean the build folder (`Shift+Cmd+K`).
    2.  Delete the project's `Derived Data` folder.
    3.  Restart Xcode and rebuild the project.

By following these steps, you will restore the ability to enter text in all fields throughout the application.
